## Growth Mindset

A *growth mindset* is one where you realise that any skill can be learned with hard work and persistance. A mistake is another opportunity to learn, a roadblock is a sign to get creative and find a new strategy.

**Remember:**
 - You only fail when you give up, so don't!
 - There is always a solution, you just have to find it.
 - By struggling you are surely improving, and therefore winning.

# HTML

## Wireframing

Wireframing allows a developer to plan out a page so they get an idea of what the finished product should look like. This helps in avoiding indecision in the middle of programming.
Wireframes are essentially basic versions of what the finished page should look like drawn with squares, including spaces for images, text layout and other page elements. They can be drawn by hand or with a program.

## HTML Code

HTML is created using a series of tags. Almost all tags have both a opening and close tag, with content in between them. If a tag is created inside another tag, the one inside is said to be 'nested'.

### Tag list

 - `<head>` - Contains metadata
 - `<title>` - Gives a name to the page. Shown at the top of the page, in the tab.
 - `<body>` - Will contain the bulk of the content
 - `<h1>-<h6>` - Headings provide structure for content and gives titles.
 - `<nav>` - Contains navigation links.
 - `<section>` - Represents a standalone section to separate content with.

## Semantics

Semantics describes the purpose of the element. 
The look of a `<h1>` heading can be recreated with styles, but the heading has other data than just its appearance.
